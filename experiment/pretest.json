			"answers": {
				"a": "Wind conditions",
				"b": "Temperature",
				"c": "Pressure",
				"d": "Chemically active fluids"
			},
			"explanations": {
				"a": "Explanation : The factors affecting the metamorphism of the rocks are temperature, pressure and chemically fluids. Wind conditions do not affect the metamorphism in any way. ",
				"b": "Explanation ",
				"c": "Explanation ",

			"question": "Factors are also called ",
			"answers": {
				"a": "Primary aspects",
				"b": "Agents of metamorphism",
				"c": "Agents of changes",
				"d": "Tertiary aspects"
			},
			"explanations": {
				"a": "Explanation ",
				"b": "Explanation :Metamorphic changes in the rocks are primarily the result of three main factors that are also sometimes called agents of metamorphism: heat, pressure and chemically active fluids.",
				"c": "Explanation ",
				"d": "Explanation "

			"question": "The temperature up to which minerals in rocks are stable is  ",
			"answers": {
				"a": "100° C",
				"b": "50° C",
				"c": "500° C",
				"d": "200° C"
			},
			"explanations": {
				"a": "Explanation ",
				"b": "Explanation ",
				"c": "Explanation ",
				"d": "Explanation :Rocks are made up of minerals that are normally stable at temperature below 200° C. However when the temperature around these rocks changes due to one reason or the other, the mineral composition of the rocks undergoes some changes "

			"question": "What is the pressure exerted during the crustal movements called?",
			"answers": {
				"a": "Indirect pressure",

			},
			"explanations": {
				"a": "Explanation ",
				"b": "Explanation :The pressure from orogenic activity is generally lateral or horizontal and is commonly termed as directed pressure.",

			"question": "What is the direction of pressure exertion in load metamorphism?",
			"answers": {
				"a": "Vertical",
				"b": "Horizontal",
				"c": "Inclined",
				"d": "Horizontal or inclined"
			},
			"explanations": {
				"a": "Explanation :The load of the overlying burden acts generally exerts pressure in a vertical direction and the process of change in the structure of the rock is often referred as load metamorphism.",
